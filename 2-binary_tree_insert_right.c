 * binary_tree_insert_right - Inserts a node as the right-child of another node

 * the parent node. If the parent already has a right child, the new
 * node replaces it and the old right child becomes the right child of
 * the new node.
 *
 * Return: Pointer to the newly created node,
 * or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
